There are no federal guidelines for permissible mold or mildew exposure limits… there are for asbestos. Mold: not the next asbestos.
There is a lack of consensus in the medical industry linking mold or mildew to specific medical ailments… unlike asbestos.
Almost every breath we take includes mold or mildew spores… not asbestos.
Mold or mildew can be prevented through proper home maintenance… asbestos cannot.
Builders put asbestos inside buildings… mold or mildew grows naturally in our environment.
If you think the same, you should consider these facts: Asbestos is manufactured… mold or mildew is not, it is an organic material.
Judging by the number of mold or mildew related claims and the increased media coverage some might think mold or mildew is the next asbestos
