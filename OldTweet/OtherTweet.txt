Furries Against Brown Root Rot Fungus
@juliawb Not downy mildew or powdery mildew ?
Yup. Remember the fuss about dreaded late blight on tomatoes? Also in the nightshade family, potatoes can get this, too. #groundchat
Late blight on spuds isn't just Ontario's problem. They're tracking it in the US, too: http:// usablight.org #groundchat
Commercial potato growers are better able to take large-scale measures to control the late blight fungus. #groundchat
Successful day clearing weeds , love the powerstrimmer! Garden looks good. Should reduce chances of powdery mildew late summer .
